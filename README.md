# Asymmetric learning and adaptability to changes in relational structure during transitive inference

This repo contains the experiment code, behavioural data and analysis code associated with the above pre-print.

## Replicating results
- The analysis.ipynb notebook contains the code for reproducing the figures and statistical tests found in the preprint.
- models.py and model_init.py contain the computational models fit to behavioural data, while model_init.py contains the code for initialising these models (necessary for model fitting + recovery etc.)
- parallel_CPT_fit.py and parallel_recovery.py contain the scripts used for model fitting + recovery analyses
- plotter.py and helpers.py contain useful functions for plots, analysis, trial sequence generation etc.
- Raw data can be found in the data folder, or likewise at dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.26147470
